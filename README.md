# Week_4, Quiz_4, Question_6

I chose to examine the question *"On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?"* because it had more than 3 variables but not too many.  It was also interesting to understand what people feel others should do.  

$\color{Aquamarine}{The\ most\ interesting\ finding\ was\ that\ some\ people\ thought\ it\ was\ unreasonable\ for\ someone\ to\ get\
up\ at\ all\ on\ a\ 6\ hour\ flight\ as\ if\ everyone\ has\ the\ same\ physical\ abilies\ and\ needs\ or\ ability\ to\ pick\ the\ 
'best\ seat'\ for\ themselves.}$  

The data shows, that of the 855 respondents, <$\color{Apricot}{**67%**}$> indecated that getting up 2 or 3 times was acceptable.
