# Week_4, Quiz_4, Question_6

I chose to examine the question *"On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?"* because it had more than 3 variables but not too many.  It was also interesting to understand what people feel others should do.  

<span style="color: aquamarine;">The most interesting finding was that some people thought it was unreasonable for someone to get up at all on a 6 hour flight as if everyone has the same physical abilies and needs or ability to pick then'best seat' for themselves.</span>

The data shows, that of the 855 respondents, <span style="color: green;">**67%**</span> indecated that getting up 2 or 3 times was acceptable.
